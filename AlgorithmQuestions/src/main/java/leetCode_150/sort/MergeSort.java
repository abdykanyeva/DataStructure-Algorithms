    - Merge sort is divide and conquer algorithm
    - Divide he input into two halves and e keep halving recursively until they become too
    small hat cannot be broken further
    - merge halves by orting them


    When you need merge sort?
    - When you need stable sort
    - When average expected time is O(nlogn)

    When to avoid merge sort?
    - When space is concern
